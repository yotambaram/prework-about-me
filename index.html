      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job after this bootcamp will be a job that will allow me to combine my experience and professional knowledge from previous jobs
         (teamwork, correct decision-making, prioritization, etc ...) with the knowledge I study in online courses and at the bootcamp of Washington University.
         But the most important thing to me is that there will be no long drive to work :)</p>

      <p>Technology is of interest to me, I have ideas for solutions with the help of code, I'm very busy with how and where the world goes in this area, it intrigues me.
        In addition, it's important for me to work where you see fast results. In software it is usually this way.</p>
